Instructions for Approximation
==============================

Importing Data:
	1) Create a spreadsheet file with the extension .xls or .xlsx 
	2) Add x-values into the “A” column
	3) Add y-values into the “B” column
	4) Save the spreadsheet file
	5) Click on the button titled “Import Data”
	6) A file selector prompt will display
	7) Select a spreadsheet with the extension .xls or .xlsx
	8) A message will display if the import is successful
	9) If the import is unsuccessful, a message will display the reason
	10) To erase the imported data, click on the button titled “Clear”

Approximation using imported data:
	1) Import the data from a spreadsheet file with the extension .xls or .xlsx
	2) Add graph and axis title if necessary
	3) Customize the plot if needed such as with grid, dark mode, and highlighting data
	4) Click on “View Points” to see only the data points imported in the coordinate system
        5) Select the equation fit type such logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial with a maximum degree
	6) Click on “Approximate” to calculate a polynomial function for the data points
	7) Edit the x-window values accordingly to fit
